As individuals, how do we get from where we are to where we want to be? Many people chose to set targets for themselves that will help them work towards achieving their goals. Let's assume your goal is to buy a House. You don't just expect to wake up one day and for the bank to hand you a mortgage. You need to save for a deposit (your target) and in this context you might also give yourself a medium-term savings target to keep you on track. Then all you need is some indicator of progress, for example, when trying to meet your deposit target you can recognize the importance of monitoring monthly savings.
