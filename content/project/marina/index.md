Marina is a PhD student under the EU project GoGreenNext, which aims to develop evidence-based policies to improve climate, biodiversity, and human health and explore their interconnections, especially in urban areas. Marina completed her undergraduate degree at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece, where she graduated with a BSc in Geology. She continued her studies at the same university, earning an MSc in Meteorology, Climatology, and Atmospheric Environment. Her Masterâ€™s thesis focused on the seasonality of extreme precipitation and temperature events over the Mediterranean region, utilizing circular statistics. Her PhD research explores the impacts of climate change on human health through its effects on air quality. By examining variables such as temperature, precipitation, and humidity, along with air quality indicators, Marina aims to quantify observed relationships and create future projections using a Generalised Additive Model (GAM). This research is crucial for developing strategies to mitigate the impacts of climate change on air quality and public health.
