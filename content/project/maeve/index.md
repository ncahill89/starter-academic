Maeve graduated from Trinity College Dublin in 2018 with a BSc in Physics and Astrophysics. She started her PhD in Maynooth University in 2021 under the supervision of Prof Andrew Parnell and Dr Niamh Cahill. Her project aims to develop a series of statistical models to analyze historical sea level records using proxy data from salt marshes and Bayesian Hierarchical techniques. This research contributes to larger group called the A4 Project, which is funded by the Marine Institute and the European Regional Development Fund and aims to examine areas of physical oceanography and climate research. Her research will examine sea level changes along the East coast of North America and Ireland. In the future, Maeve will collaborate with Earth Scientists in Trinity College Dublin, to produce Irelandâ€™s first historic sea level record from Irish salt marshes and statistical models.
