abstract: We examine fossil foraminiferal assemblages from 20 sediment cores to assess sudden relative sea-level (RSL) changes across three mud-over-peat contacts at three salt marshes in northern Humboldt Bay, California. 
We use a validated foraminiferal-based Bayesian transfer function to evaluate the variability of subsidence stratigraphy at a range of 30-6000â€‰m across an estuary. 
We use the consistency in RSL reconstructions to support estimates of coseismic subsidence from megathrust earthquakes.
